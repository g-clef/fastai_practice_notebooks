    "A while ago, I downloaded a bunch of images from a Bing image search of various kinds of baked foods: cakes, cookies, pies, etc. So, we first set up the path to those files. I have them stored on an external share, but it turns out that disc i/o to those files matters quite a lot in feeding data to the video card, so I copied them to a local drive. This was also a chance to clean up the image files a little bit. In a previous training run, the Python Image Library (PIL) complained about some of the files having invalid EXIF information, so in the copy process I stripped out all of the exif data from the images. (you can do this by just opening the file in PIL, then saving it somewhere else, so the copy process was just opening the file in PIL, then saving it from PIL.) "

In this case, I'm asking FastAI to automatically create a `valid` set out of the full set of images, by asking it to set aside 20% of the images to test it's results.

    "With all that built, we now do something from FastAI learning called \"fine tuning\". Fine tune is a special helper function in FastAI that codifies a few common steps in transfer learning. It's important to mention at this point that by using `resnet` as a starting model we're doing something called \"transfer learning\". Basically that means we're using a model trained for one thing, and applying that model with most of its existing training parameters, keeping most of that, and just re-training it on our new data. The advantage of this approach is that we're not starting from scratch to train a new model every time we build a new model. Since `resnet` has been trained to identify many things in real life (cats, cars, people, etc), we are going to \"transfer\" that training to identify baked goods in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "What fine_tune does is two learning passes (we'll talk more about what a learning pass is later), one with the model \"frozen\", and one with it \"unfrozen\". A \"frozen\" model is only training the last layer, while an unfrozen model is training the whole thing. The \"1\" argument to `fine_tune` is the number of \"epochs\" to train over. An \"epoch\" is the number of passes across the dataset to take, so 1 epoch is basically sending each image to the model once only. (in this case twice, once when frozen, once when unfrozen). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is difficult to  understand without talking about the model itself. ML models are generally multi-layer things, where a mathematical function is applied to the input, then a layer of an \"activation\" function is applied (which is basically a decision about whether to include these results to the layer above it, with a \"weight\" to indicate the strength of that inclusion), then another layer of mathematical function is applied to that output and another \"activation\" function, and on and on, for many layers. The last layer with its activations is the one that has to match the expected number of classes you're working with, so it's the layer that's removed and re-trained in transfer learning."

One of the next things to look at are the images that are mis-classified most often, or are the most confusing for the system. Helpfully, FastAI includes a widget to help you see these, called the ImageClassifierCleaner. It will show you the highest-loss images, and let you choose to manually classify them or remove them."
